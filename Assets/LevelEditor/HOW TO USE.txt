Welcome to the grid terrain level editor!

Creating the level:
Open/Create a scene, right-click in object hierarchy and select Create Game Level.
GameObject named Level will be created. It has components Terrain, Terrain Collider, Terrain Helper and Level Grid
I recommend leaving Level at position (0,0,0) as it simplifies the grid coordinates.

Terrain component:
In first tab you can change height of the terrain and paint textures on it.
In second tab you can add trees, but it may clash with our grid, not recommended.
In third tab you can paint details like grass.
In settings(the fourth tab) you can switch between normal and pixelart materials(they blend textures differently).
Don't change Terrain size(except height), Control Texture Resolution and Heightmap Resolution here.

Terrain Helper component:
Terrain size -> Set size of terrain here. The terrain must be square for heightmap, detailmap and our grid to line up.
(We can hide unused terrain parts later, don't worry)
Visualize -> Show clues about height, walkability and prefabs when mouse is over the terrain.
	Grid distance -> How many cells around the mouse are shown.
Terrain Painting:
Paint Walkability -> Set cells under mouse walkable or unwalkable with left-click.
Paint Prefabs -> Add any prefab on cells under mouse with left-click.
	Painted Prefab -> Place your prefab in this slot.
	Add -> Adds selected prefab to cell.
	Replace -> Replaces all prefabs in cell with prefab in slot.
	Remove -> Removes selected prefab from cell, removes all if no prefab selected.

Level Grid component:
Set Unwalkable Angle -> Automatically sets cells unwalkable if slope is above angle, does nothing if 0.
Use Terrain -> Samples level height from terrain
Use Props -> Sample takes into account height and walkability of props
Use Prefabs(not implemented) -> Default prefabs added depending on terrain textures
Sample Terrain -> Bakes level data using methods selected above

Adding Props to level:
Any GameObject in the scene with component implementing IProp is recognized as a prop.
Props need colliders to sample height from them.
PropDummy is basic example of a prop.

Level Grid in code:
The level is available as a singleton in LevelGrid.Instance property
For programming gameplay you can use these methods (described in code comments):
Int2 GetMapSize()
float GetHeight(int x, int z)
void SetHeight(int x, int z, float height)
bool IsWalkable(int x, int z)
void SetWalkable(int x, int z, bool value)
GameObject ShowPrefabsAt(int x, int z)
void HidePrefabsAt(int x, int z)
void HidePrefabsAll()
There are other methods which are undocumented, they are used for level baking in editor, but it is possible to use them at runtime too.
