This library provides the following types of functions written in HLSL:

- Classic Perlin noise (2D/3D)
- Periodic Perlin noise (2D/3D)
- Simplex noise (2D/3D)
- Analytical derivatives of simplex noise (2D/3D)

The source code for these functions is released under the conditions of the
MIT license. Please see the header of each file for details.
