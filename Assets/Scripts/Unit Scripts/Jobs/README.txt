When creating a new job, right-click on the project window and click Create -> 'Grandmaster Job'.
A new asset representing a new job should have been made. Rename to anything you want.
Click on the asset and in the inspector you'll find two arrays representing base stats and level growths.

When assigning stats keep in mind of the array order:

	Size			DO NOT CHANGE THIS
	MHP				Maximum Hit Points
	MMP				Maximum Magic Points
	ATK				Attack Power
	DEF				Defense
	SPR				Spirit / Magic Defense
	SPD				Speed / Combat agility
	MOV				Movement reach
	JMP				Jump / Vertical terrain reach
